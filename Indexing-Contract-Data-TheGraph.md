# The Graph

![](https://i.imgur.com/t6l6hfP.png)

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is a decentralized query protocol and indexing service for the blockchain. It allows developers to easily track events being emitted from smart contracts on various networks, and write custom data transformation scripts, which are run in real time. The data is also made available through a simple GraphQL API which developers can then use to display things on their frontends.

## Prerequisites

- We will be using yarn which is a package manager just like npm.
- Please install yarn from [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) If your computer doesn't have yarn already installed
- Please watch this 40 minute tutorial on [GraphQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQL7tL2S0oQ)
- If you dont know what axios is, Watch this short [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LyagkoRWYA)
- You should have completed the [Chainlink VRF tutorial](https://github.com/LearnWeb3DAO/Chainlink-VRFs)

## How it Works

![](https://i.imgur.com/IOIoroJ.png)

1. A dApp sends a transaction and some data gets stored in the smart contract.
   2/ This smart contract then emits one or more events.
2. Graph's node keeps scanning Ethereum for new blocks and the data for your subgraph that these blocks may contain.
3. If the node finds an event you were looking for and defined in your subgraph, it runs the data transformation scripts (mappings) you defined. The mapping is a WASM (Web assembly) module that creates or updates data `Entities` on the Graph Nodes in response to the event.
4. We can query the Graph's node for this data using the [GraphQL Endpoint](https://graphql.org/learn/)

(Referenced From The Graph’s website)

## Build

We will be using the folder named `RandomWinnerGame` that you created in the `Chainlink VRF` tutorial

Create an abi.json file inside your `RandomWinnerGame` folder (You will need this file to intilialize your graph) and copy the following [content](https://github.com/LearnWeb3DAO/Graph/blob/master/abi.json).

Note this is the abi of the `RandomWinnerGame` contract you created in the Chainlink VRF tutorial

So your final folder structure should look like this:

```bash
RandomWinnerGame
    - hardhat-tutorial
    - abi.json
```

To create your subgraph you will need to go to [The Graph's Hosted Service](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/)

Login using your GitHub account and visit `My Dashboard` tab

![](https://i.imgur.com/pFtBOc9.png)

Click on `Add Subgraph`, fill in the information and create the subgraph

![](https://i.imgur.com/4gfdUUf.png)

When your subgraph is created, it will show you some commands in `Install`, `Init` and `Deploy`

![](https://i.imgur.com/xS4Fdme.png)

In your terminal execute this command pointing to `RandomWinnerGame` folder:

```bash
yarn global add @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

If this doesn't work for you, you can try using `npm`. `npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli`

After that execute this command but replace `GITHUB_USERNAME` with your Github username and `YOUR_RANDOM_WINNER_GAME_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` with the address of the RandomWinnerGame contract that you deployed in your Chainlink VRF tutorial. Press enter for all the questions after that :)

```bash
graph init --contract-name RandomWinnerGame --product hosted-service GITHUB_USERNAME/Learnweb3  --from-contract YOUR_RANDOM_WINNER_GAME_CONTRACT_ADDRESS  --abi ./abi.json --network mumbai graph
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/Y5NTkGD.png)

For the deploy key, go to [The Graph's Hosted Service](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/), click on `My Dashboard`, copy the `Access Token` and paste it for the `Deploy Key`

```bash
   graph auth
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/CkFmiv1.png)

Now the last two commands to execute are:

```bash
cd graph
yarn deploy
# or `npm run deploy`
```

You can go back to [The Graph's Hosted Service](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/) and click on `My Dashboard` you will be able to see your graph because its deployed now 🚀 👀

![](https://i.imgur.com/OOEbDgB.png)

Boom you have deployed your first graph!!!

Now comes the fun part where we will modify the default code provided to us by The Graph into the code which can help us track events for our contract.

**Lets get started**

Open up you `subgraph.yaml` inside the `graph` folder and add a `startBlock` to the yaml file after the `abi: RamdomWinnerGame` line, to get the startBlock you will need to go to [Mumbai PolygonScan](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/) and search up your contract address, after that you will need to copy the block number of the block in which your contract was deployed

The start block doesn't come with the default settings but because we know that we only need to track the events from the block the contract was deployed, we will not need to sync the entire blockchain but only the part after the contract was deployed for tracking the events

![](https://i.imgur.com/HVQ24Un.png)

```bash
source:
  address: "0x889Ef69261272Caa27f0655D0208bAc7055EDAD5"
  abi: RandomWinnerGame
  startBlock: BLOCK_NUMBER
```

Your final file should look something like [this](https://github.com/LearnWeb3DAO/Graph/blob/master/graph/subgraph.yaml#L11)

Okay now its time to create some `Entities`. `Entities` are objects which define the structure for how your data will be stored on `The Graph's nodes`. If you want to read more about them, click on this [link](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developer/create-subgraph-hosted/#defining-entities)

We will need an `Entity` which can cover all the variables we have in our events so that we can keep track of all of them. Open up for `schema.graphql` file and replace the already existing lines of code with the following lines of code:

```graphql
type Game @entity {
  id: ID!
  maxPlayers: Int!
  entryFee: BigInt!
  winner: Bytes
  requestId: Bytes
  players: [Bytes!]!
}
```

- `ID` is the unique identifier for a game and will be equivalent to the `gameId` variable we have in our contract.
- `maxPlayers` will keep track of how many max players are allowed in this game.
- `entryFee` is the fees to enter into the game and it is a BigInt because we have `entryFee` as a `uint256` in our contract which is a BigNumber
- `winner` is the address of the winner in the game and is defined as Bytes because address is a hexadecimal string
- `requestId` is also a hexadecimal string and thus is defined as `Bytes`
- `players` is the list of addresses for the players in the game and because each address is a hexadecimal string, we have signified players as a Bytes array
- Also note that `!` indicates required variables, we have `maxPlayers`, `entryFee`, `players` and `id` marked as required because when the `Game` initially starts it will emit the `GameStarted` event which will emit these three variables(`maxPlayers`, `entryFee` and `id`) so a `Game` entity can never be created without these three variables and for the players array, it will be initialized to an empty array by us.
- `winner` and `requestId` will come with `GameEnded` event and `players` will keep track of every `player address` which is emitted by the `PlayerJoined` event

If you want to learn more about the types you can visit this [link](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developer/create-subgraph-hosted/#built-in-scalar-types)

Okay, so now we have let the graph know what kind of data we will be tracking and what will it contain 🥳 🥳 🥳

Now its time to query this data 🎉

Graph has an amazing functionality that given the `Entity` it can auto generate large chunk of code for you!!!

Isn't that amazing? Lets use that functionality. In your terminal pointing to the graph directory execute this command

```bash
yarn codegen
```

After this `The Graph` would have created most of the code for you expect of the mappings. If you look at the file inside `src` named `random-winner-game.ts`, the Graph CLI would have created for you some functions each pointing to one of the events that you created in your contract. These functions get called everytime the Graph finds an event relating to these functions. We will add some code to these functions so that we can store the data when an event comes in.

Replace the `random-winner-game.ts` file content with following lines

```typescript
import { BigInt } from "@graphprotocol/graph-ts";
import {
  PlayerJoined,
  GameEnded,
  GameStarted,
  OwnershipTransferred,
} from "../generated/RandomWinnerGame/RandomWinnerGame";
import { Game } from "../generated/schema";

export function handleGameEnded(event: GameEnded): void {
  // Entities can be loaded from the store using a string ID; this ID
  // needs to be unique across all entities of the same type
  let entity = Game.load(event.params.gameId.toString());
  // Entities only exist after they have been saved to the store;
  // `null` checks allow to create entities on demand
  if (!entity) {
    return;
  }
  // Entity fields can be set based on event parameters
  entity.winner = event.params.winner;
  entity.requestId = event.params.requestId;
  // Entities can be written to the store with `.save()`
  entity.save();
}

export function handlePlayerJoined(event: PlayerJoined): void {
  // Entities can be loaded from the store using a string ID; this ID
  // needs to be unique across all entities of the same type
  let entity = Game.load(event.params.gameId.toString());
  // Entities only exist after they have been saved to the store;
  // `null` checks allow to create entities on demand
  if (!entity) {
    return;
  }
  // Entity fields can be set based on event parameters
  let newPlayers = entity.players;
  newPlayers.push(event.params.player);
  entity.players = newPlayers;
  // Entities can be written to the store with `.save()`
  entity.save();
}

export function handleGameStarted(event: GameStarted): void {
  // Entities can be loaded from the store using a string ID; this ID
  // needs to be unique across all entities of the same type
  let entity = Game.load(event.params.gameId.toString());
  // Entities only exist after they have been saved to the store;
  // `null` checks allow to create entities on demand
  if (!entity) {
    entity = new Game(event.params.gameId.toString());
    entity.players = [];
  }
  // Entity fields can be set based on event parameters
  entity.maxPlayers = event.params.maxPlayers;
  entity.entryFee = event.params.entryFee;
  // Entities can be written to the store with `.save()`
  entity.save();
}

export function handleOwnershipTransferred(event: OwnershipTransferred): void {}
```

Lets understand what is happening in `handleGameEnded` function

- it takes in the `GameEnded` event and expects `void` to be returned which means nothing gets returned from the function
- It loads a `Game` object from `Graph's` db which has an ID equal to the `gameId` that is present in the event that Graph detected
- If an entity with the given `id` doesn't exist return from the function and dont do anything
- If it exists, set the winner and the requestId from the event into our Game Object(Note `GameEnded` event has the winner and requestId)
- Then save this updated Game Object back to the `Graph's DB`
- For each game there will be a unique `Game` object which will have a unique `gameId`

Now lets see what's happening in the `handlePlayerJoined`

- It loads a `Game` object from `Graph's` db which has an ID equal to the `gameId` that is present in the event that Graph detected
- If an entity with the given `id` doesn't exist, return from the function and dont do anything
- To actually update the player's array, we need to reassign the property on the entity that contains the array (i.e. players) similar to how we assign values to other properties on the entity (e.g. maxPlayers). Therefore, we need to create a temporary array which contains all of the existing entity.players elements, push to that, and reassign entity.players to be equal to the new array.
- Then save this updated Game Object back to the `Graph's DB`

- Now lets see what's happening in the `handleGameStarted`
  - It loads a `Game` object from `Graph's` db which has an ID equal to the `gameId` that is present in the event that Graph detected
  - If an entity like that doesn't exist create a new one, also initialize the players array
  - Then set the maxPlayer and the entryFee from the event into our Game Object
  - Save this updated Game Object back to the `Graph's DB`

You can now go to your terminal pointing to the `graph` folder and execute the following command:

```bash
yarn deploy
# or `npm run deploy`
```

After deploying, [The Graph's Hosted Service](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/) and click on `My Dashboard` you will be able to see your graph.

Click on your graph and make sure it says synced, if not wait for it to get synched before proceeding

### Website

To develop the website we would be using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Next Js](https://nextjs.org/). React is a javascript framework which is used to make websites and Next Js is built on top of React.

First, You would need to create a new `next` app. Your folder structure should look something like

```
   - RandomWinnerGame
       - graph
       - hardhat-tutorial
       - my-app
       - abi.json
```

To create this `my-app`, in the terminal point to RandomWinnerGame folder and type

```bash
    npx create-next-app@latest
```

and press `enter` for all the questions

Now to run the app, execute these commands in the terminal

```
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

Now lets install Web3Modal library(https://github.com/Web3Modal/web3modal). Web3Modal is an easy-to-use library to help developers add support for multiple providers in their apps with a simple customizable configuration. By default Web3Modal Library supports injected providers like (Metamask, Dapper, Gnosis Safe, Frame, Web3 Browsers, etc), You can also easily configure the library to support Portis, Fortmatic, Squarelink, Torus, Authereum, D'CENT Wallet and Arkane.
Open up a terminal pointing at`my-app` directory and execute this command

```bash
  npm install web3modal
```

In the same terminal also install `ethers.js`

```bash
npm i ethers
```

We will also be using `axios` to send requests to the graph, so lets install that

```bash
npm i axios
```

In your public folder, download this [image](https://github.com/LearnWeb3DAO/Graph/blob/master/my-app/public/randomWinner.png) . Make sure that the name of the downloaded image is `randomWinner.png`

Now go to `styles` folder and replace all the contents of `Home.modules.css` file with the following code, this would add some styling to your dapp:

```css
.main {
  min-height: 90vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  font-family: "Courier New", Courier, monospace;
}

.footer {
  display: flex;
  padding: 2rem 0;
  border-top: 1px solid #eaeaea;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

.input {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100%;
  padding: 1%;
  margin: 2%;
  box-shadow: 0 0 15px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06);
  border-radius: 10px;
}

.image {
  width: 70%;
  height: 50%;
  margin-left: 20%;
}

.title {
  font-size: 2rem;
  margin: 2rem 1rem;
}

.description {
  line-height: 1;
  margin: 2rem 1rem;
  font-size: 1.2rem;
}

.log {
  line-height: 1rem;
  margin: 1rem 1rem;
  font-size: 1rem;
}

.button {
  border-radius: 4px;
  background-color: blue;
  border: none;
  color: #ffffff;
  font-size: 15px;
  padding: 8px;
  width: 200px;
  cursor: pointer;
  margin: 2rem 1rem;
}
@media (max-width: 1000px) {
  .main {
    width: 100%;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
  }
}
```

Lets now write some code to query the graph, create a new folder inside your `my-app` folder and name it `queries`. Inside the `queries` folder create a new file named `index.js` and paste the following lines of code:

```javascript
export function FETCH_CREATED_GAME() {
  return `query {
        games(orderBy:id, orderDirection:desc, first: 1) {
            id
            maxPlayers
            entryFee
            winner
            players
        }
    }`;
}
```

As you can see we created a `GraphQL` query where we said we want a `game` object where data is ordered by Id(which is the gameId) in decending order and we want the first game from this ordered data

Lets simplify this with an example: Suppose you have three game objects stored inside the `The Graph's` node.

```json
     {
      "id": "1",
      "maxPlayers": 2,
      "entryFee": "10000000000000",
      "winner": "0xdb6eaffa95899b53b27086bd784f3bbfd58ff843"
    },
    {
      "id": "2",
      "maxPlayers": 2,
      "entryFee": "10000000000000",
      "winner": "0x01573df433484fcbe6325a0c6e051dc62ab107d1"
    },
    {
      "id": "3",
      "maxPlayers": 2,
      "entryFee": "100000000000000",
      "winner": "0x01573df433484fcbe6325a0c6e051dc62ab107d1"
    },
    {
      "id": "4",
      "maxPlayers": 2,
      "entryFee": "10",
      "winner": null
    }
```

Now you want the latest game every single time. To get the latest game, you will first have to order them by Id and then put this data in decending order so that gameId 4 can come at the top(It will be the current game) and then we say `first:1` because we only want the gameId 4 object, we dont care about the old games.

You can actually see this query working on the graph's hosted service. Lets try to do that:

I have already deployed a graph, lets look at my graph and use the query to query it, Go to [this link](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/sneh1999/learnweb3)

Replace the example query with our query and click on the purple play button

![](https://i.imgur.com/vwkDrqT.png)

You can see some data coming up for my graph 👀 and the id of the game is 4

Simple right? Yes, indeed 😎

You can go to your graph through `My dashboard` and do the same things 🚀, it will be fun

Lets continue...

It was nice doing it through the already provided UI by `Graph` but to use this on our frontend we will need to write an axios post request so that we can get this data from the graph

Create a new folder named `utils` and inside the folder create a new file named `index.js`. Copy the following lines of code inside the `index.js` file:

```javascript
import axios from "axios";

export async function subgraphQuery(query) {
  try {
    // Replace YOUR-SUBGRAPH-URL with the url of your subgraph
    const SUBGRAPH_URL = "YOUR-SUBGRAPH-URL";
    const response = await axios.post(SUBGRAPH_URL, {
      query,
    });
    if (response.data.errors) {
      console.error(response.data.errors);
      throw new Error(`Error making subgraph query ${response.data.errors}`);
    }
    return response.data.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    throw new Error(`Could not query the subgraph ${error.message}`);
  }
}
```

Lets try to understand what's happening in this function

It needs a `SUBGRAPH_URL`, you will need to replace "YOUR-SUBGRAPH-URL" with the url of your subgraph which you can get by going to the graph's [hosted service](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service) clicking on `My dashboard` and then on your graph. Copy the url under `Queries(HTTP)`
![](https://i.imgur.com/ekQvnwa.png)

It then calls this url with the query that we created using axios post request

Then it handles any errors and sends back the reponse if there are no errors

Now open your `index.js` file under the `pages` folder and paste the following code, explanation of the code can be found in the comments.

```javascript
import { BigNumber, Contract, ethers, providers, utils } from "ethers";

```

Now create a new folder under the my-app folder and name it `constants`.
In the constants folder create a file, `index.js` and paste the following code.

- Replace `"address of your RandomWinnerGame contract"` with the address of the RandomWinnerGame contract that you deployed and saved to your notepad.
- Replace `---your abi---` with the abi of your RandomWinnerGame Contract. To get the abi for your contract, go to your `hardhat-tutorial/artifacts/contracts/RandomWinnerGame.sol` folder and from your `RandomWinnerGame.json` file get the array marked under the `"abi"` key.

```javascript
export const abi = "---your abi---";
export const RANDOM_GAME_NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS =
  "address of your RandomWinnerGame contract";
```

Now in your terminal which is pointing to `my-app` folder, execute

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your RandomWinnerGame dapp should now work without errors 🚀

Have fun and play the game!
