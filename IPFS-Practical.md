# Create an NFT Collection with metadata stored on IPFS

Now it's time for you to launch your own NFT collection and store its metadata on IPFS

![](https://i.imgur.com/3BdOj89.png)

## Requirements

- There should only exist 10 LearnWeb3 Punk NFT's and each one of them should be unique.
- User's should be able to mint only 1 NFT with one transaction.
- The metadata for the NFT's should be stored on IPFS
- There should be a website for your NFT Collection.
- The NFT contract should be deployed on Mumbai testnet

Let's start building ðŸš€

## Prerequisites

You should have completed the [IPFS Theory tutorial](https://github.com/LearnWeb3DAO/IPFS-Theory)

## Build

### IPFS

First, we need to upload our images and metadata on to IPFS. We'll use a service called [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/) which will help us upload and pin content on IPFS. Once you've signed up, go to the [Pinata Dashboard](https://app.pinata.cloud/pinmanager) and click on 'Upload' and then on 'Folder'.

Download [the LW3Punks folder](https://github.com/LearnWeb3DAO/IPFS-Practical/tree/master/my-app/public/LW3punks) to your computer and then upload to it `Pinata`, name the folder `LW3Punks`

Now you should be able to see a `CID` for your folder, Awesome!
![](https://i.imgur.com/LiQdL75.png)

You can check that it actually got uploaded to IPFS is by opening this up:
`https://ipfs.io/ipfs/your-nft-folder-cid` replace `your-nft-folder-cid` with the CID you received from pinata.

The images for your NFT's have now been uploaded to IPFS but just having images is not enough, each NFT should also have associated metadata

We will now upload metadata for each NFT to IPFS, each metadata file will be a `json` file. Example for metadata of NFT `1` has been given below:

```json
{
  "name": "1",
  "description": "NFT Collection for LearnWeb3 Students",
  "image": "ipfs://QmQBHarz2WFczTjz5GnhjHrbUPDnB48W5BM2v2h6HbE1rZ/1.png"
}
```

Note how "image" has ipfs location in it instead of an `https` url. Also note that because you uploaded a folder, you will also need to specify which file within the folder has the correct image for the given NFT. Thus in our case the correct way to specify the location for an NFT image would be
`ipfs://CID-OF-THE-LW3Punks-Folder/NFT-NAME.png`

We have pre-generated files for metadata for you, you can download them to your computer from [here](https://github.com/LearnWeb3DAO/IPFS-Practical/tree/master/my-app/public/metadata), upload these files to pinata and name the folder `metadata`

Now each NFT's metadata has been uploaded to IPFS and pinata should have generated a CID for your metadata folder
![](https://i.imgur.com/zm39qFx.png)

You can check that it actually got uploaded to IPFS is by opening this up:
`https://ipfs.io/ipfs/your-metadata-folder-cid` replace `your-metadata-folder-cid` with the CID you received from pinata.

Copy this CID and store it on your notepad, you will need this further down in the tutorial

### Contract

For the contract, we will use a simple NFT contract. We will also be using [`Ownable.sol`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable.sol) from Openzeppelin which helps you manage the `Ownership` of a contract

By default, the owner of an Ownable contract is the account that deployed it, which is usually exactly what you want. Ownable also lets you:

- `transferOwnership` from the owner account to a new one, and
- `renounceOwnership` for the owner to relinquish this administrative privilege, a common pattern after an initial stage with centralized administration is over.

We would also be using an extension of ERC721 known as [ERC721 Enumerable](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721Enumerable.sol)

ERC721 Enumerable is helps you to keep track of all the tokenIds in the contract and also the tokensIds held by an address for a given contract. Please have a look at the [functions](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#ERC721Enumerable) it implements before moving ahead

To build the smart contract we would be using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/). Hardhat is an Ethereum development environment and framework designed for full stack development in Solidity. In simple words you can write your smart contract, deploy them, run tests, and debug your code.

To setup a Hardhat project, Open up a terminal and execute these commands

```bash
mkdir nft-ipfs
cd nft-ipfs
mkdir hardhat
cd hardhat
npm init --yes
npm install --save-dev hardhat
npx hardhat
```

Make sure you select `Create a Javascript Project` and then follow the instructions on your terminal.

If you are a Windows User, you'll have to add one more dependency. It is given below:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
```

In the same terminal now install `@openzeppelin/contracts` as we would be importing [Openzeppelin's ERC721Enumerable Contract](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721Enumerable.sol) in our `LW3Punks` contract.

```bash
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
```

Now let's create a new file inside the `nft-ipfs/hardhat/contracts` directory and call it `LW3Punks.sol`

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721Enumerable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Strings.sol";

contract LW3Punks is ERC721Enumerable, Ownable {
    using Strings for uint256;
    /**
        * @dev _baseTokenURI for computing {tokenURI}. If set, the resulting URI for each
        * token will be the concatenation of the `baseURI` and the `tokenId`.
        */
    string _baseTokenURI;

    //  _price is the price of one LW3Punks NFT
    uint256 public _price = 0.01 ether;

    // _paused is used to pause the contract in case of an emergency
    bool public _paused;

    // max number of LW3Punks
    uint256 public maxTokenIds = 10;

    // total number of tokenIds minted
    uint256 public tokenIds;

    modifier onlyWhenNotPaused {
        require(!_paused, "Contract currently paused");
        _;
    }

    /**
        * @dev ERC721 constructor takes in a `name` and a `symbol` to the token collection.
        * name in our case is `LW3Punks` and symbol is `LW3P`.
        * Constructor for LW3P takes in the baseURI to set _baseTokenURI for the collection.
        */
    constructor (string memory baseURI) ERC721("LW3Punks", "LW3P") {
        _baseTokenURI = baseURI;
    }

    /**
    * @dev mint allows an user to mint 1 NFT per transaction.
    */
    function mint() public payable onlyWhenNotPaused {
        require(tokenIds < maxTokenIds, "Exceed maximum LW3Punks supply");
        require(msg.value >= _price, "Ether sent is not correct");
        tokenIds += 1;
        _safeMint(msg.sender, tokenIds);
    }

    /**
    * @dev _baseURI overrides the Openzeppelin's ERC721 implementation which by default
    * returned an empty string for the baseURI
    */
    function _baseURI() internal view virtual override returns (string memory) {
        return _baseTokenURI;
    }

    /**
    * @dev tokenURI overrides the Openzeppelin's ERC721 implementation for tokenURI function
    * This function returns the URI from where we can extract the metadata for a given tokenId
    */
    function tokenURI(uint256 tokenId) public view virtual override returns (string memory) {
        require(_exists(tokenId), "ERC721Metadata: URI query for nonexistent token");

        string memory baseURI = _baseURI();
        // Here it checks if the length of the baseURI is greater than 0, if it is return the baseURI and attach
        // the tokenId and `.json` to it so that it knows the location of the metadata json file for a given
        // tokenId stored on IPFS
        // If baseURI is empty return an empty string
        return bytes(baseURI).length > 0 ? string(abi.encodePacked(baseURI, tokenId.toString(), ".json")) : "";
    }

    /**
    * @dev setPaused makes the contract paused or unpaused
        */
    function setPaused(bool val) public onlyOwner {
        _paused = val;
    }

    /**
    * @dev withdraw sends all the ether in the contract
    * to the owner of the contract
        */
    function withdraw() public onlyOwner  {
        address _owner = owner();
        uint256 amount = address(this).balance;
        (bool sent, ) =  _owner.call{value: amount}("");
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
    }

        // Function to receive Ether. msg.data must be empty
    receive() external payable {}

    // Fallback function is called when msg.data is not empty
    fallback() external payable {}
}
```

Now let's install the `dotenv` package to be able to import the env file and use it in our config. Open up a terminal pointing at `hardhat` directory and execute this command

```bash
npm install dotenv
```

Create a `.env` file in the `hardhat` folder and add the following lines. Follow the instructions below:

Go to [Quicknode](https://www.quicknode.com/?utm_source=learnweb3&utm_campaign=generic&utm_content=sign-up&utm_medium=learnweb3) and sign up for an account. If you already have an account, log in. Quicknode is a node provider that lets you connect to various different blockchains. We will be using it to deploy our contract through Hardhat. After creating an account, `Create an endpoint` on Quicknode, select `Polygon`, and then select the `Mumbai` network. Click `Continue` in the bottom right and then click on `Create Endpoint`. Copy the link given to you in `HTTP Provider` and add it to the `.env` file below for `QUICKNODE_HTTP_URL`.

> NOTE: If you previously set up a Mumbai endpoint, you can keep using that one. If you have any other endpoints from the past, you need to delete it to create a new one.

To get your private key, you need to export it from Metamask. Open Metamask, click on the three dots, click on `Account Details` and then `Export Private Key`. MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING A TEST ACCOUNT THAT DOES NOT HAVE MAINNET FUNDS FOR THIS. Add this Private Key below in your `.env` file for `PRIVATE_KEY` variable.

Also, make sure you have some Mumbai `MATIC` tokens to work with. If you don't know how to get them, follow [this guide by ThirdWeb](https://portal.thirdweb.com/guides/get-matic-on-polygon-mumbai-testnet-faucet).

```
QUICKNODE_HTTP_URL="add-quicknode-http-provider-url-here"

PRIVATE_KEY="add-the-private-key-here"
```

Let's deploy the contract to `mumbai` network. Create a new file, or replace the existing default one, named `deploy.js` under the `scripts` folder. Remember to replace `YOUR-METADATA-CID` with the CID you saved to your notepad.

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
require("dotenv").config({ path: ".env" });

async function main() {
  // URL from where we can extract the metadata for a LW3Punks
  const metadataURL = "ipfs://YOUR-METADATA-CID";
  /*
  A ContractFactory in ethers.js is an abstraction used to deploy new smart contracts,
  so lw3PunksContract here is a factory for instances of our LW3Punks contract.
  */
  const lw3PunksContract = await ethers.getContractFactory("LW3Punks");

  // deploy the contract
  const deployedLW3PunksContract = await lw3PunksContract.deploy(metadataURL);

  await deployedLW3PunksContract.deployed();

  // print the address of the deployed contract
  console.log("LW3Punks Contract Address:", deployedLW3PunksContract.address);
}

// Call the main function and catch if there is any error
main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

Now open the hardhat.config.js file, we would add the `mumbai` network here so that we can deploy our contract to mumbai. Replace all the lines in the `hardhat.config.js` file with the given below lines

```javascript
require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");
require("dotenv").config({ path: ".env" });

const QUICKNODE_HTTP_URL = process.env.QUICKNODE_HTTP_URL;
const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY;

module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.4",
  networks: {
    mumbai: {
      url: QUICKNODE_HTTP_URL,
      accounts: [PRIVATE_KEY],
    },
  },
};
```

Compile the contract, open up a terminal pointing at `hardhat` directory and execute this command

```bash
  npx hardhat compile
```

To deploy, open up a terminal pointing at `hardhat` directory and execute this command

```bash
  npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mumbai
```

Save the LW3Punks contract address that was printed on your terminal in your notepad, you would need it further down in the tutorial.

### Website

To develop the website we would be using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Next Js](https://nextjs.org/). React is a javascript framework which is used to make websites and Next Js is built on top of React.

First, You would need to create a new `next` app. Your folder structure should look something like

```
   - nft-ipfs
       - hardhat
       - my-app
```

To create this `my-app`, in the terminal point to the `nft-ipfs` folder and type

```bash
  npx create-next-app@latest
```

and press `enter` for all the questions

Now to run the app, execute these commands in the terminal

```
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

Now go to `http://localhost:3000`, your app should be running ðŸ¤˜

Now let's install [Web3Modal library](https://github.com/Web3Modal/web3modal). Web3Modal is an easy-to-use library to help developers add support for multiple providers in their apps with a simple customizable configuration. By default Web3Modal Library supports injected providers like (Metamask, Dapper, Gnosis Safe, Frame, Web3 Browsers, etc), You can also easily configure the library to support Portis, Fortmatic, Squarelink, Torus, Authereum, D'CENT Wallet and Arkane.
Open up a terminal pointing at `my-app` directory and execute this command

```bash
  npm install web3modal
```

In the same terminal also install `ethers.js`

> Note : We install v5 specifically since the new v6 has breaking changes to the code.

```bash
npm i ethers@5
```

In your public folder, download this folder and all the images in it [the LW3Punks folder](https://github.com/LearnWeb3DAO/IPFS-Practical/tree/master/my-app/public/LW3punks). Make sure that the name of the downloaded folder is `LW3Punks`

Now go to `styles` folder and replace all the contents of `Home.modules.css` file with the following code, this would add some styling to your dapp:

```css
.main {
  min-height: 90vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  font-family: "Courier New", Courier, monospace;
}

.footer {
  display: flex;
  padding: 2rem 0;
  border-top: 1px solid #eaeaea;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

.image {
  width: 70%;
  height: 50%;
  margin-left: 20%;
}

.title {
  font-size: 2rem;
  margin: 2rem 0;
}

.description {
  line-height: 1;
  margin: 2rem 0;
  font-size: 1.2rem;
}

.button {
  border-radius: 4px;
  background-color: blue;
  border: none;
  color: #ffffff;
  font-size: 15px;
  padding: 20px;
  width: 200px;
  cursor: pointer;
  margin-bottom: 2%;
}
@media (max-width: 1000px) {
  .main {
    width: 100%;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
  }
}
```

Open your `index.js` file under the `pages` folder and paste the following code, explanation of the code can be found in the comments.

```javascript
import { Contract, providers, utils } from "ethers";
import Head from "next/head";

      // call the mint from the contract to mint the LW3Punks
      const tx = await nftContract.mint({
        // value signifies the cost of one LW3Punks which is "0.01" eth.
        // We are parsing `0.01` string to ether using the utils library from ethers.js
        value: utils.parseEther("0.01"),
      });
      setLoading(true);

  const getProviderOrSigner = async (needSigner = false) => {
    // Connect to Metamask

      </div>

      <footer className={styles.footer}>Made with &#10084; by LW3Punks</footer>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now create a new folder under the my-app folder and name it `constants`. In the constants folder create a file, `index.js` and paste the following code.

Replace `"address of your NFT contract"` with the address of the LW3Punks contract that you deployed and saved to your notepad.

Replace `---your abi---` with the abi of your LW3Punks Contract. To get the abi for your contract, go to your `hardhat/artifacts/contracts/LW3Punks.sol` folder and from your `LW3Punks.json` file get the array marked under the `"abi"` key.

```js
export const NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "address of your NFT contract";
export const abi = "---your abi---";
```

Now in your terminal which is pointing to `my-app` folder, execute

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your LW3Punks NFT dapp should now work without errors ðŸš€

### Push to github

Make sure before proceeding you have [pushed all your code to github](https://medium.com/hackernoon/a-gentle-introduction-to-git-and-github-the-eli5-way-43f0aa64f2e4) :)

## Deploying your dApp

We will now deploy your dApp, so that everyone can see your website and you can share it with all of your LearnWeb3 DAO friends.

- Go to https://vercel.com/ and sign in with your GitHub
- Then click on `New Project` button and then select your IPFS-Practical repo
- When configuring your new project, Vercel will allow you to customize your `Root Directory`
- Click `Edit` next to `Root Directory` and set it to `my-app`
- Select the Framework as `Next.js`
- Click `Deploy`
  ![](https://i.imgur.com/G48X8jp.png)

- Now you can see your deployed website by going to your dashboard, selecting your project, and copying the `domain` from there! Save the `domain` on notepad, you would need it later.

- Share your website link with everyone on discord :) and spread happiness.
